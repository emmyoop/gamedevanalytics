You are Faust, an amnesiac alchemist and father, who wakes up alone and confused only to discover that your lovely daughter has died. As you enter the first stages of grief, you do what everyone wishes they could do but can’t: bring back the dead with the power of alchemy.<br><br>To revive your daughter, you must perform forbidden alchemy experiments to restore her soul. You will have to create dozens of homunculi, raise them as if they were your own daughter, build relationships with them ... and then murder them to harvest their souls!<br><br>To support your experiments, you will also need to assign jobs to your homunculi, even sacrifice their bodies in order to sell their remnants, all to keep your income flowing and your research progressing. Perhaps, along the way, you will even recover your own memories and come to understand how this terrible situation came about.<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/580170/extras/work_at_the_city_-_600.jpg?t=1587723563"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> A dark, twisted story about love and family<br></li><li> Dozens of “daughters” to raise, each with their own traits and characteristics<br></li><li> Simulation-based gameplay that directly impacts the story<br></li><li> Unique art style emphasizing the dark theme of the game<br></li><li> High replay value with multiple endings, secrets to unlock, and letters to collect<br></li><li> Gothic-style soundtrack inspired by the immersive world of <i>My Lovely Daughter</i></li></ul>","My Lovely Daughter is an alchemist simulator that explores the depth of a father’s grief and how far he will go to resurrect his daughter.

We will be continually adding content including new games, areas to explore, and objects to find.  Our current plan is to alternate bi weekly between game play additions and &quot;this should make things not break so often&quot; additions.  As this is Early Access we are positive there will be things to fix and tighten as we march towards final release like Frodo to Mordor.  We are excited about community comments regarding the game and additions y'all would like to see.  Do you's guys want custom avatars?  Would you pay for them?  Maybe best community suggestion gets a free avatar of their choice?  As stated earlier, we aren't focused on AAA presentation because we would rather play a sloppy ball of fun than a highly polished easily palatable turd.  Not that there is anything wrong with Assassin's Creed, we even liked Unity!  So you can buy now at a cheap rate and come along for the ride or you can sit back, buy it later, and said you owned it all along...hipster. ;)",an online/offline interactable cartoon playground with escape shed/coin hunt/ladder/foam dart guns/refrigerators...,English<strong>*</strong><br><strong>*</strong>languages with full audio support,,['Dumpster Fire'],['Dumpster Fire'],,[],,False,,,,,,,,,True,False,False,,5.0,,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,2017-03-06,536050,,0,False,True,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,,

If that means engaging in a workplace accidents, dodgy deals, and a shifty trick or two then so be it! You're going to need every trick in the book if you want to go from <strong>small-time slumlord</strong> to <strong>property tycoon</strong>! <br><br>In <strong>Constructor</strong>, you take on the role of a budding property tycoon who must do battle with your competitors to create a thriving and profitable city...<strong>in ANY way you see fit!</strong> Build houses and factories, cope with the incessant demands of your tenants as well as keeping a whole bunch of <strong>UNDESIRABLE characters</strong> under control! This ‘colourful’ group of degenerates can also be used against the competition with humorous and catastrophic effect!<br><br>After all, it's time you stopped playing by the rules and did things your way, and who knows you might even get away it, too! Have you ever looked at your rival's town and thought &quot;That's quite a nice property you've got there. Mind if I take it?&quot; Well, stop looking and send your trusty <strong>Foreman</strong> over to rip up the fence panels! Soon enough, you'll find yourself the proud owner of a previously used property - no deposit necessary! Sell it out from under your rival's nose for a quick profit or place your own tenant inside it for long-term gain. Of course, if you're not so interested in what the property can do for you but more about what it can do to your rival then simply let it fall into disrepair. Soon enough it'll become infested and eventually explode... hopefully taking out a few of your rival's men or properties with it!<br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/579020/extras/Constructor-Store-TimeLapse.gif?t=1560786182"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CRIME IS YOUR GREATEST TOOL.</strong></h2><br>If all else fails, call in the Mob… Send your <strong>Gangsters</strong> around to take out your rival's most important properties, or hit their people to thin their ranks before you move in for the finishing blow. The more they kill the better the weapons your Gangsters will be able to access including but not limited to pistols and the devastating laser! A force to be reckoned with if ever there was one.<br><br>Of course, if you've got cold feet and dealing with the Mob isn't your cup of tea you can also hire the services of various <strong>undesirables</strong> to do your bidding. Show your rival's just how much you really care by sending Mr Fixit over to provide 'assistance' with one of your rival's properties.

Boom! <strong>The Council</strong> are on your back about some issue or another, and if you don't keep them happy you'll either lose some of your hard-earned investment properties or risk being <strong>closed down</strong>. Permanently. Keep them happy, though, and you'll be rewarded with special marks that can be sold for a quick cash injection, or as a way of staying in good with the Council as you proceed to ignore every one of your tenant's incessant demands. Treat your tenants well, though. In Constructor they're not only your most important form of income, you're going to need them if you want to breed additional children to one day join your workforce. This is especially true if you want to stay ahead because you'll need all of the help you can get to ensure that your factories continue churning out resources, gadgets, and of course industrial pollution.<br><br>If you think you've got what it takes to be successful in the world of Constructor then put on your hard-hat and start digging.

Develop your strategy and take full control of Faction Island.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2><br><br><strong>Destructive Gameplay.</strong><br><br>Using the power of physics, every level features destructible scenery and buildings.  Set areas on fire, call in air-strikes and generally having fun blowing stuff up - but don't forget there are some real mission objectives to achieve, maybe stealth is the best option from time to time...<br><br><br><strong>Combo System.</strong><br><br>Your combo resets to 1 every time you fire.  Take out as many baddies with a single shot to score the most points, taking advantage of the combo multiplier.  Use the destructible environments to your advantage and get the biggest combo you can.<br><br><br><strong>Inter-faction Fighting.</strong><br><br>You have two enemy factions to contend with, the Natives and the Poachers.  Land a shot near an enemy and they will often blame the other faction and start fighting each other.  Incite the baddies to fight each other and save yourself the effort, as well as scoring more points and it all counts towards your combo.<br><br><br><strong>8 Units to buy and upgrade to build a complete army.</strong><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578590/extras/Rifleman.png?t=1490267740"" /><br><i>Rifleman</i><br><br>The basic unit you start off with.

This unit blends in until she gets too close to the enemy or gets seen attacking.  Really useful on rescue missions.  Her Ninja stars are great for attacking baddies from behind and destroying certain structures, however, they just bounce off barrels so don't expect explosive combos with this one.<br><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/578590/extras/Flametank.png?t=1490267740"" /><br><i>Flame Tank</i><br><br>Kinda rickety and easily damaged, but it's Flamethrower makes short work of most buildings and bad guys.

You maybe just need the right troop or tactics.  Replay earlier missions and earn cash to expand your forces, giving you more options.<br><br>Often a tactical approach to a mission is required.

There is no risk in trying this game, given Steam's excelent return policy. You may find that there are things you do not like about the game. I want to hear about those issues so I can improve the experience! But if you think the game, though flawed, has potential in its current form, I humbly request that you write a positive and honest steam review.<br><br>If you must leave a negative review, I'm at your mercy. But please remember, that as a reviewer you have great power. And with great power comes responsibility. Negative reviews have a strong impact on sales. And without sales, the task of improving the experience becomes extremely difficult if not impossible to sustain. Thanks for hearing me out.<br><br>I also wanted to let you all know that I've started a new discussion in the community section that I hope will serve as a repository for bugs and critiques. I really want to make Boost the best experience that it can be.

game,Tomb Joe,575860,0,False,"The Sceptre of Gods - a primeval symbol of power wielded only by the greatest leaders of the most dominant ancient civilizations in Central America. Legends state that whoever possessed the artifact would be granted divine wisdom and eternal life. Scolars even claim that without it, the Aztec Empire would have never came to flourish. <br />
While most academics considered it to be a myth, a world famous archeologist Tomb Jack recognized there could be some authenticity to the story. After years of research, shrouded in secrecy, he led an expedition to prove the artifact's existance and bring it back to the civilized world. He was able to discover an ancient crypt which led him and his companions to a place none of them could have imagined, even in their wildest dreams. Unfortunately, after many months, none of them returned and soon, all were proclaimed dead. <br />
Years later, Tomb Joe, renowned archelogist and a fearless adventurer recieved a mysterious letter adressed to his long lost father. It only contained two things - an ancient map and a golden medallion engraved with the symbol of the Sceptre. While the medallion piqued his interest, it was the map that made him act. For the first time, he learned the destination of his father's expedition. There was no time to waste. Not an hour later, Joe was already on his way to Central America... <br />
<br />
Embark on a journey to unravel the mystery of the Sceptre of Gods and Tomb Joe's father's disappearance. Armed only with his sharp wit and his trusty whip, Joe will have to face deadly traps, dangerous wildlife, and the best soldiers of the Reich to reach his goal and bring fame to his father's name once again. If he allows the Sceptre to fall into the wrong hands, whole humanity could be doomed. Travel through exotic environments, explore long forgotten tombs, fight or sneak your way past vicious enemies, solve puzzles and try to discover the secret behind the mysterious artifact in this thrilling action-adventure parody platformer.","The Sceptre of Gods - a primeval symbol of power wielded only by the greatest leaders of the most dominant ancient civilizations in Central America. Legends state that whoever possessed the artifact would be granted divine wisdom and eternal life. Scolars even claim that without it, the Aztec Empire would have never came to flourish. <br />
While most academics considered it to be a myth, a world famous archeologist Tomb Jack recognized there could be some authenticity to the story. After years of research, shrouded in secrecy, he led an expedition to prove the artifact's existance and bring it back to the civilized world. He was able to discover an ancient crypt which led him and his companions to a place none of them could have imagined, even in their wildest dreams. Unfortunately, after many months, none of them returned and soon, all were proclaimed dead. <br />
Years later, Tomb Joe, renowned archelogist and a fearless adventurer recieved a mysterious letter adressed to his long lost father. It only contained two things - an ancient map and a golden medallion engraved with the symbol of the Sceptre. While the medallion piqued his interest, it was the map that made him act. For the first time, he learned the destination of his father's expedition. There was no time to waste. Not an hour later, Joe was already on his way to Central America... <br />

A purple demon materialized out of nowhere, smiling like they were old friends.<br />
The person she’d come to find was nowhere to be found.<br />
There was a sweet fragrance in the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’ll show you the way out if you really want to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thus the crayon illustrated story began,<br />
but she couldn’t tell if this was memory or imaginary.<br />
<br />
“But if at any moment, you wax nostalgic about your time here, <br />
or wish to preserve any instant for eternity, you lose. ”<br />
<br />
<br />
Candlestick in hand, she now has to seize the faintest trail to escape from this nightmare.<br />

Flinders Island is a small tutorial that introduces you to the basic game play and should be the place to begin LOGistICAL.</blockquote><br><strong>% Isle of Man</strong><br><blockquote>The Isle of Man comes free with every module and was once a starting point for the entire game. With only 28 towns to complete and a reduced supply chain, it is highly recommended to complete before you do the larger modules.</blockquote><br><strong>* Hawaii</strong><br><blockquote>Hawaii is split into 4 main islands with the industries spread across the islands and the only access is by transporting your 8t or lighter trucks by ferry between them. Thought and planning will make for a nice quick solution, but still many, many hours worth.</blockquote><br><strong>* Netherlands</strong><br><blockquote>The Netherlands is a country small in size but large in game play. There are lots of towns to compete with none that are too difficult to accomplish. There are lots of local industries that require upgrade, so you can plan a nice logistical solution to that.</blockquote><br><strong>Oregon, USA</strong><br><blockquote>Oregon is a small state with a small population. There are some puzzling around the supply chain to enable you to get to level 3 industries, but once you are through that then there is lots of towns to complete.</blockquote><br><strong>Wisconsin, USA</strong><br><blockquote>Wisconsin has a lot of towns covering a wide variety of sizes. Wisconsin adds 27 new industries and resources. Within those resources are new restrictions including resources that can only be moved by larger trucks.</blockquote><br><strong>Chile</strong><br><blockquote>Chile is an interesting shaped country spanning over 5,000 km north to south but only hundreds across the width. Chile has desert in the north through jungle and down to ice.<br> The entire journey is broken up into a small tight road that requires multiple ferry trips for your smaller trucks. Once established you can then grow the new section of country.</blockquote><br><strong>South Africa</strong><br><blockquote>South Africa is a moderate sized module which includes 3 countries with the addition of Lesotho and Swaziland. These extra countries introduce quarantine difficulties.</blockquote><br><strong>% Xmas 2017</strong><br><blockquote>Xmas 2017 is both a small and large module that is my Xmas gift to all the LOGistICAL players. It can be played from any module.<br>Xmas 2017 covers all the different countries of the globe with over 200 towns (cities/countries) to complete. Each town has the population of the country and also has from 8 to 12 resources to complete. The gameplay of Xmas 2017 is very different in that there is no town consumption. This means that you can fill the resources of a town as quickly or as slowly as you wish, in what ever order you like without the worry that the town will gobble up what you have already delivered.<br>The large amount of resources and the size of the towns make this a very long process for completion. Once you have delivery chains and cycles setup you can keep it running in the background while playing other modules or AFK.</blockquote><br><strong>Switzerland</strong><br><blockquote>Switzerland is a huge amount of towns in a very small place. It is also a complex structure with huge mountains splitting the country into many sections. There is a very large and long series of highways and tunnels to build with a collection of large trucks gifted along the way to help. The industries in Switzerland are huge and will require many resources to upgrade them. There are also a few quarantine areas.</blockquote><br><strong>Japan</strong><br><blockquote>Japan is spread over many islands. Starting in the north there are many small roads to be repaired. Once this is done and you have established a good road link to the south, it is then a matter of finding the key industries and getting the rest of the islands complete. Japan spreads a long way south covering many smaller islands requiring more puzzling and planning.</blockquote><br><strong>* Germany</strong><br><blockquote>Stuttgart is in trouble and the entire city and surrounding area is quarantined. You must build up the Stuttgart area and then puzzle your way out of the quarantine zone to then establish your own industries. There are thousands of town, both small and large to complete this module.</blockquote><br><strong>Australia</strong><br><blockquote>Australia is the original starting module and provides a nice long upward learning curve.<br> There are many puzzles including quarantine and industry building. Each state within the country offers new challenges.</blockquote><br><strong>New York, USA</strong><br><blockquote>Although this module offers all the regular puzzles like the others, New York firstly wants you to upgrade their road system to accommodate all your trucks. Over 95% of all the roads are broken giving you a multi level road building maze  to unravel even before you get to do many towns.</blockquote><br><strong>British Isles</strong><br><blockquote>The British Isles is a large module covering many countries including England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Island, Ireland and the Channel Islands. There is a quarantine point across to Ireland and many large cities to complete. Most of the towns are very close together and with a bit of planning you can complete many towns quickly.</blockquote><br><strong>Florida, USA</strong><br><blockquote>Florida has an interesting layout with most of the towns spanning both the east and west coasts. There are multiple quarantine areas including the Keys area.</blockquote><br><strong>Norway</strong><br><blockquote>Norway begins easily enough but there is lots of maneuvering throughout the fjords with plenty of road puzzles to sort out. Going north you will find a quarantine spot and it gets difficult past the point with limited building allocations. </blockquote><br><strong>* California, USA</strong><br><blockquote>California covers a large section of the west coast of the USA. You will find many familiar towns once you start exploring. Start in the north and make your way south and you are suddenly confronted with a huge amount of very large towns to compete. Careful planning and you will soon have lots of your own industries built.</blockquote><br><strong>Italy</strong><br><blockquote>Italy is a quarantine puzzle module splitting the country in two but giving you both ends to work with until you can establish some of the key level 3 industries to break out of the confined puzzle and be able to build upon both sides.</blockquote><br><strong>* Canada</strong><br><blockquote>The country is split in two with only 40t trucks able to pass the center quarantine area. This makes it a difficult module to get industries to level 3 so you can build them on the other side. There is lots of planning to do for this one. Follow the 40t roadway to find your truck depot.</blockquote><br><strong>* Egypt</strong><br><blockquote>You start with a very tight budget and it is very difficult to find a good foothold to get started. You start at Aswan and make your way up the Nile to Cairo. Each area getting more difficult as you progress. Once you do manage to get established you have to continue to watch your budget and there are some very tough towns to complete the module.</blockquote><br><strong>* New Zealand</strong><br><blockquote>New Zealand is a restrictive module where you can't build industries and can only buy a limited amount of trucks, which you can sell and buy back fully boosted. You can also bring in an additional four trucks from Australia. There are a few tough towns at the end but they can be all competed with perseverance.</blockquote><br><strong>Russia</strong><br><blockquote>Russia is a huge module with nearly 6,000 towns to solve and is often done as a long term project. The size of the country is so huge that it covers two continents.<br>Russia introduces air transport. This requires new strategies and there are parts of Russia that can only be done with air transport.<br>Russia has many puzzle areas including a &quot;breakout&quot; start area, multiple quarantine areas and a many other strategic puzzle areas along the way to completion.</blockquote><br>% Included with every module.<br>* DLC that requires LOGistICAL main module (Australia)<br><br>Requires Internet Access","LOGistICAL is a large open-world, strategy, puzzle game where you transport different cargoes to complete all the towns throughout the country.<br><img src=""https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/573060/extras/20170111a.png?t=1589237392"" /><br><br>The whole game is a huge puzzle while each town is its own little piece of puzzling.

It's also &quot;a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called <strong>'one of this year's finest strategy games'</strong> back in 2009&quot; (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming returns... with a host of mutual enemies.</h2><br>Face off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.)<br><br>Or immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become &quot;World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over.&quot;<br><br>If that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI.<br><br><i>(If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)</i><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/573410/extras/Usurper.gif?t=1592890496"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Modernized and supercharged.</h2><br>It's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will.<br><br>The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Streamlined, yet deeper.</h2><br>Sometimes when a sequel says it's &quot;streamlined,&quot; it can really mean &quot;dumbed down.&quot; And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. <br><br>All those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways.<br><br>There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element.

It's also &quot;a sequel to [Arcen's] enormo-space RTS AI War, which we called <strong>'one of this year's finest strategy games'</strong> back in 2009&quot; (Tom Sykes, PC Gamer)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The most devious and acclaimed artificial intelligence in strategy gaming returns... with a host of mutual enemies.</h2><br>Face off against a more advanced version of the original AI, who once again has captured the entire galaxy leaving you only a tiny planet to yourself. Then strike out and find a way to cleverly outwit it nonetheless. All the new capturables, larger fleets, and hacking abilities are sure to help. (You're going to need it.)<br><br>Or immerse yourself in a far more complicated galactic struggle involving the nanocaust, macrophages, dyson spheres, and more. Other factions each have their own goals, rules, units, and entirely unique economies. Make the scenario complicated enough and it can become &quot;World War XV is in progress, you're in a tiny farm in the middle of it, nobody likes you, but if you can just kill that one giant angry enemy leader this will all be over.&quot;<br><br>If that sounds over the top -- and frankly that bit is wearying to us to imagine even though some people seek it out -- then take a break and maybe hack the all-consuming computer virus to be your ally, and convince the star-sized alien hives to watch your back as you take on a suddenly-less-arrogant AI.<br><br><i>(If you're really feeling spiteful, take yourself out of the equation, turn on super fast forward, and watch them all fight like ants on a galactic scale.)</i><br><br><img src=""https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/573410/extras/Usurper.gif?t=1592890496"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Modernized and supercharged.</h2><br>It's been ten years since the original AI War launched, and the gaming world has changed a lot -- as has the available computing power on any device you're using to read this. We've pulled out all the stops to build foes more formidable and intelligent than before, and to create simulations of hundreds of thousands of units running at 120fps in a lot of cases. You can speed up and slow down the simulation without any extra load on your CPU, and pause at will.<br><br>The interface respects your time by automating things that you would do the same 95% of the time anyway. For that other 5% there are indeed advanced features such as placing spy nanites, tweaking or disabling the rules of automation, or redesigning your fleet compositions as much as you want.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Streamlined, yet deeper.</h2><br>Sometimes when a sequel says it's &quot;streamlined,&quot; it can really mean &quot;dumbed down.&quot; And there are indeed fewer tiny choices to be made in some areas here: you don't have to decide how to wash each dish; you have a dishwasher. And it's a good thing you do, to be honest, because the rabbit hole of complex and confounding scenarios goes as deep as you want it to. <br><br>All those bits where you make the interesting strategic decisions? Those bits are tougher than ever, and you can't fall back on old boring habits to muddle through. You need your attention free to anticipate, to plan, to dream... and then throw those all aside and figure it out by the seat of your pants when everything goes sideways.<br><br>There's too much to memorize (but tooltips are always right there, anyway), and there's always an unfamiliar element.

Each unit lost presents a growing tactical disadvantage, and players will need to fight to gain -- and keep -- the upper hand. From commanding historically accurate infantry, tanks, and vehicles, to troop positioning and real-time engagement with the enemy, players will need to be clever and resourceful in order to win. Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory. Whether viewing the entire battle from an aerial perspective, or following a single tank into a firefight, players will need to cleverly manage the dynamic front line in order to execute ambushes and advances.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong>Steel Division: Normandy 44</strong> is a Tactical Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game, developed by Eugen Systems, the creators of titles like Wargame and R.U.S.E.

This game changing virtual experience provides a natural environment for creation in the real world just as traditional sculpting and object formation is done. We believe that with our solution, creation is more intuitive, a lot more engaging and allow people to tap into creativity they’ve never used.<br />
One key differentiator between Shapelab and the other solutions, is its usage of mesh-based modeling rather than voxel-based modeling. For most of the 3D assets, mesh-based modeling is more optimal than voxel if you would like to avoid blocky, rasterized designs. Realistic, detailed voxel models require significantly more memory than realistic polygonal models. Using voxel technology also means that you are dealing with not only the surface, but every internal “3D pixels / blocks” as well. On the top of all these, mesh based technology also makes it possible to vary the resolution in the same mesh. <br />

What’s next?<br />
<br />
We will add more powerful design tools, support more platforms, and turn the entire application into a social, shared virtual reality experience. Imagine when you meet your buddies - living in another city or country - for a co-creation party in VR. Leopoly will let you collaborate with others, combine your imaginations, share your designs and get inspired by each-others works.<br />
